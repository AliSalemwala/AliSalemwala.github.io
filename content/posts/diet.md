# Turkey:
I lived here from August 2015 to May 2021. I started out as a university student on a strict self-appointed budget, and transitioned into an extremely highly paid professional without any budget really, but with a focus on remaining economical wherever possible. What this means is, I started to enjoy myself and indulge in little (and sometimes not so little) pleasures. On the whole, however, I did not move onto luxury.

My biggest regret for my university years is the obsession I had with conserving every penny. This cost me numerous opportunities of all kinds, and I guess I’ll never fully know what I missed out on; it’s entirely possible I didn’t miss out on anything, but that wouldn't pacify the pessimist in me. One piece of advice, don’t save money just to save it. Have a plan for what it will be used for, and if you can’t plan anything for it then spend it on something you’ll enjoy “in the now”. Misery is not a virtue. Get it?

My biggest regrets for my short-lived time of luxury are:
1. Not having enough time to blow the cash I was getting (COVID-19 started a month after I got my first baller salary), and
2. Not managing a budget to see where my money went, even though it made absolutely no difference to me.

I’d suggest keeping a budget, if not for the money then at least just to see where it all goes. It can give you a good sense of direction, priorities, and inefficiencies.

Anyway, the reason I’m writing up the Turkish section now is because I’ve been in Munich over three weeks now, made my way through the discounters and Turkish shops here, talked to a few locals, and have conclusively decided my diet will be in for big changes. It’s best to let the Turkish version go now, and note it down here before it leaves my mind.

I usually bought my food from BIM or A-101, because they were the cheapest stores close to my home. Vegetables and fruits, I purchased from Soykan because it had a good balance of freshness, quality, and price. Everyday I ate the same thing, and saw good results, fast. Combined with a rigorous gym routine, you’ll notice improvements fast.

The items in the graph represent raw ingredients, and were usually combined into meals based on what was logical and convenient at the time. I don’t have records of the macros exactly, but all of my requirements were satisfied. Fruits and vegetables, of course, depended on the season.

I’m around 173 cm and to gain weight and muscle fast, this is a pretty good diet. Low in saturated fats and empty calories. High in fiber. Great protein content. Enough carbohydrates to keep your energy up. Hits every segment of vitamins, minerals, and all that other stuff. No processed foods. High in volume so you stay full for a long time. Nothing is processed, no sweets, no fake Nestle “fruit juices”. Adaptable, and easy to prepare.

This was also during COVID and work-from-home, by the way, so I was just attending meetings while I had my mercimek boiling in the background, or chicken baking in the oven, or oats soaking in honey and milk. I didn’t need to constantly be in the kitchen cooking, is what I mean. That’s something I’ve been struggling with in Germany so far, but let’s see what the future holds.

That’s it for Turkey. I haven’t got my German diet down to a science yet; I’m facing some challenges there, but that’s to be expected. It’s still better than my American diet of canned beans and corn and gallons of milk, at least. This is fun, I hope I can do it for many more countries to come.
