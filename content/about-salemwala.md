This drab, gray website is an acccurate expression of my soul. The best *About Me* section would be blank page, with two Spider-Men pointing at each other, but I'm not sure how many of your working hours you can waste staring at that. Thus, these words. Hopefully, your working hours are for the HR or recruiting department for a next-gen, cutting-edge, all-the-bells-and-whistles startup, and these billed and wasted hours can be shared with me, in the future.

I don't know what your hiring manager will ask, but hopefully there will be some relevant information about that in my CV **ADD CV HERE**. Since you saw the picture on this page, I'm guessing your other hand is busy, and it might be hard to click that link. I'll just write a short something here. I'm 24 years old (young enough to have promise, old enough to be a disappointment). I graduated from Bilkent University, in Ankara, Turkey in 2019 (before they discovered strategically placed mirrors were an excellent way to prevent academic dishonesty). I studied Computer Engineering, and entered a job market in full bloom (my luck, in contrast, was wilted, but I did get a free trip to Amsterdam out of my escapades). I landed eventually at Bayzat, a wonderful company full of wonderful people who were talented at their work. Does being around them make me talented by proxy? I work best with Flutter, for their mobile application, but I have also touched Kotlin in the Spring framework and React with Typescript, with varying degrees of incompetence. In my free times, I fantasize about dabbling in complex things like IPFS and blockchain, and end up actually dabbling towrads simpler goals, like making a static website in Hugo.

I realized while writing all this how boring my life really is. I might go get addicted to heroin, smack a pimp, lose everything I own, and then gain it all again. And then update this section. It'll be hell on my body, but at least you'll have more fun reading this page. I'm sorry for everything.
