      <description>Turkey: I lived here from August 2015 to May 2021. I started out as a university student on a strict self-appointed budget, and transitioned into an extremely highly paid professional without any budget really, but with a focus on remaining economical wherever possible. What this means is, I started to enjoy myself and indulge in little (and sometimes not so little) pleasures. On the whole, however, I did not move onto luxury.</description>

      <description>Making something like this is as simple as it looks. There were a few things I wrestled with, mainly GitHub submodules, but I ended up getting through. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain them further down, both for your sake and my own. I know I&amp;rsquo;ll forget it all in a week.
Note: It has been exactly 8 weeks since I wrote that note above. I still have not completed this post. I remember absolutely nothing from when I first made it.</description>
